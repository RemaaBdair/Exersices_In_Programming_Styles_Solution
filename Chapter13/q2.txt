q2:Mismatch. What happens if the sorted method of WordFrequencyManager is renamed to sorted_freqs, for example? 

This will cause an error as there is no implementation for sort() that exists in the interface.
We need to provide an implementation to the sort() or rename the sort() or add sorted_freq() as a new function to the interface.
